# Polyga Grasshopper Component

This component allows to control a Polyga V1 camera through Grasshopper. 

The required Polyga libraries are not included and have to be requested from Polyga. Copy all dll files to the output directory and add SBSDKNet3 to the project dependencies. 

Currently there is a bug that the component crashes Grasshopper on startup if Rhino is not started through Visual Studio.
